    "Threat": "The SSH protocol (Secure Shell) is a method for secure remote login from one computer to another.  \nThe target is using deprecated SSH cryptographic settings to communicate.",
    "Impact": "A man-in-the-middle attacker may be able to exploit this vulnerability to record the communication to decrypt the session key and even the messages.",
    "Solution": "Avoid using deprecated cryptographic settings.  \nUse best practices when configuring SSH. \nRefer to Security of Interactive and Automated Access Management Using Secure Shell (SSH) (https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/nistir/7966/final) . \nSettings currently considered deprecated: \n\n1.Ciphers using CFB or OFB: \nThese are considered uncommon and deprecated due to vulnerabilities when compared to newer cipher chaining modes such as CTR or GCM. \n \n2.RC4 cipher (arcfour, arcfour128, arcfour256): \nThe RC4 cipher is no longer considered secure and exhibits cryptographic bias. \n \n3.Ciphers with a 64-bit block size (DES, 3DES, Blowfish, IDEA, CAST): \nThese ciphers may be vulnerable to birthday attacks (Sweet32). \n \n4.Key exchange algorithms using DH group 1 (diffie-hellman-group1-sha1, gss-group1-sha1-*): \nDH group 1 uses a 1024-bit key size, which is considered too short and vulnerable to Logjam-style attacks. \n\n5.Key exchange algorithm \"rsa1024sha1\": \nThis algorithm is very uncommon and deprecated due to its short RSA key size. \n\n6.MAC algorithm \"umac-32\": \nThis algorithm is extremely uncommon and deprecated due to its very short MAC length. \n\n7.Cipher \"none\": \nThis cipher is available only in SSHv1. \n\n8.MAC algorithm \"MD5\": \nAll MD5 based mac algorithms are deprecated. \n\n9.96-bit MAC: \nboth sha1 and sha2 variants of 96 bit macs are considered deprecated.  \n\n10.CBC Ciphers: \nAll CBC Ciphers are deprecated.",
