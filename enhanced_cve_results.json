While the context is 'Linux', the description doesn't explicitly mention Linux as the affected OS, but rather a specific software product (schneider-electric ecostruxure_cybersecurity_admin_expert). However, certificate validation bypass is a core aspect of the query, making it highly relevant. The potential impact of credential leakage and unauthorized access further increases its relevance. | Poor context match - may be wrong platform/software | Vulnerability type matches",
