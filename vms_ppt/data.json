An attacker needs network access to the vulnerable server and a tool capable of generating self-signed or fraudulently obtained certificates with an extended validity period.  No special credentials are required.\n\nExploitation involves creating a malicious server mimicking the legitimate Evolution-ews server.  The attacker crafts a self-signed certificate with a seemingly valid but actually incorrect maximum validity date, bypassing the missing validation check in the vulnerable application.  They then use techniques like DNS spoofing or ARP poisoning to redirect users to their malicious server.  Users, unaware of the fraudulent certificate, connect, potentially exposing sensitive data like emails, calendars, and contacts.  The attacker can passively monitor this traffic or actively manipulate the connection to inject malicious code or exfiltrate data.\n\nPost-exploitation could involve lateral movement within the victim's network if the compromised account has sufficient privileges.  The attack complexity is Low due to the ease of creating a fraudulent certificate and the lack of authentication checks.  Tools like OpenSSL can be used to generate certificates, while tools like Ettercap or Wireshark can facilitate network redirection and traffic analysis.  This attack aligns with the TTPs of reconnaissance, credential access, and data exfiltration.  The potential impact is high, leading to data breaches and potential account compromise."

An attacker requires network access to port 443 of the vulnerable PaperCut server.  No special credentials are initially needed; the vulnerability lies in the insecure communication channel itself.\n\nExploitation involves intercepting communication between the PaperCut Print Deploy server and clients.  This can be achieved using a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack, potentially with tools like Burp Suite or Wireshark, to capture and manipulate traffic.  The attacker presents their own self-signed certificate, which the client accepts due to the misconfiguration.  This allows the attacker to decrypt and read sensitive data transmitted between the client and server, including printer configurations and potentially user credentials if transmitted insecurely.\n\nThe impact includes data exfiltration, potentially revealing sensitive print jobs or user information.  Further exploitation depends on the data intercepted.  For example, compromised credentials could lead to privilege escalation within the PaperCut system or even the wider network.\n\nAttack complexity is Medium.  While setting up a MITM attack requires some technical skill, the vulnerability's core weakness is the lack of certificate validation on the client side, making exploitation relatively straightforward once network access is established.  Common tools include Burp Suite, Wireshark, and potentially custom scripts for automated interception and analysis.  The attacker's TTPs would involve reconnaissance, MITM attack execution, data exfiltration, and potentially lateral movement."

            "exploitation_methods": "The primary attack vector for CVE-2024-4282 exploits the weak SHA1 hashing algorithm used for SSH authentication on vulnerable Brocade SANnav OVA instances.  Attackers require only network access to port 22.  No prior credentials are needed for a successful exploit, though obtaining them beforehand would simplify the process.\n\nExploitation involves using a tool like `ssh` with a known vulnerability-specific exploit or a custom script leveraging a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack to downgrade the SSH connection to SHA1.  This allows for easier password cracking via techniques like brute-forcing or dictionary attacks, significantly accelerated by the weakness of SHA1.  Automated tools like Hashcat can be employed for this purpose.  Manual exploitation would involve crafting custom packets to force the downgrade and then performing a brute-force attack.\n\nSuccessful exploitation grants attackers complete control over the vulnerable SANnav OVA.  This allows for data exfiltration, modification, or deletion of SAN configuration data, potentially impacting the entire storage area network.  Privilege escalation to other systems within the network is also possible if the OVA has access to other network resources.\n\nThe attack complexity is Low due to the readily available tools and the inherent weakness of SHA1.  The impact is High, as complete compromise of the SANnav OVA is possible.  Defenders should immediately upgrade to SANnav 2.3.1b or later to mitigate this vulnerability.  Network segmentation and intrusion detection systems monitoring for SSH brute-force attempts are also crucial defensive measures."

Attackers need only network access to port 443; no prior credentials or internal network knowledge are required.  Exploitation involves crafting a malicious client certificate with an invalid signature.  This can be done manually by generating a self-signed certificate or using tools like OpenSSL to create a certificate with deliberately flawed parameters.  The attacker then connects to the VPN gateway using this invalid certificate.  The vulnerability allows authentication to succeed despite the invalid signature, granting the attacker access to the VPN.\n\nThe impact is high:  full access to the VPN's internal network resources.  This could lead to data exfiltration, lateral movement within the network, and potentially system compromise depending on the attacker's skills and the target's internal security posture.  Post-exploitation activities could involve pivoting to other internal systems or escalating privileges.\n\nAttack complexity is low.  Generating a malformed certificate is relatively straightforward, even manually.  Automated exploitation could be achieved by integrating certificate generation into existing VPN penetration testing tools or scripts.  Common tools include OpenSSL, Burp Suite (for intercepting and manipulating SSL traffic), and Metasploit (potentially, if a suitable module is developed).  Defenders should prioritize patching to the latest PAN-OS version and rigorously audit certificate validation configurations on their GlobalProtect deployments."

        "Impact": "If the browser is used in a shared computing environment where more than one person may use the browser, then \"autocomplete\" values may be retrieved or submitted by an unauthorized user.",
        "Solution": "Contact the vendor to have the AutoComplete attribute disabled for the password field in all forms. The AutoComplete attribute should also be disabled for the user ID field.  \nDevelopers can add the following attribute to the form or input element: autocomplete=\"off\"  \nThis attribute prevents the browser from prompting the user to save the populated form values for later reuse.   \nMost browsers no longer honor autocomplete=\"off\" for password input fields. These browsers include  Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge, IE, Opera \nHowever, there is still an ability to turn off autocomplete through the browser and that is recommended for a shared computing environment. \nSince the ability to turn autocomplete off for password inputs fields is controlled by the user it is highly recommended for application to enforce strong password rules.",

An attacker needs network access to the Plesk Panel (port 443) and prior knowledge that the autocomplete attribute is not disabled.  No special credentials are initially required.\n\nExploitation involves accessing the vulnerable login page (e.g., `/admin/reseller/login-info/`) on an unattended workstation where a legitimate user previously logged in. The browser will automatically populate the username and password fields.  The attacker simply submits the form, gaining access.  This can be automated using scripting tools like Selenium or even simple browser automation extensions.\n\nSuccessful exploitation grants the attacker complete control over the compromised Plesk Panel account, depending on the user's privileges. This could range from accessing website files and databases to managing server configurations and potentially gaining access to other systems within the network.  The impact is high, allowing for data exfiltration, system compromise, and potentially further lateral movement.\n\nAttack complexity is low.  The vulnerability is easily exploitable with minimal technical skills.  Common tools include web browsers (for manual exploitation), Selenium or similar browser automation frameworks (for automated exploitation), and potentially network scanning tools to identify vulnerable Plesk instances.  Post-exploitation activities would depend on the attacker's goals, ranging from data theft to complete server takeover."

However, the usage of SCRAM over plaintext is strongly\\ndiscouraged as it is considered an insecure practice [2]. Apache Kafka recommends deploying SCRAM exclusively with TLS encryption to protect SCRAM exchanges from interception [3].\\nDeployments using SCRAM with TLS are not affected by this issue.\\n\\nHow to Detect If You Are Impacted:\\nIf your deployment uses SCRAM authentication over plaintext communication channels (without TLS encryption), you are likely impacted.\\nTo check if TLS is enabled, review your server.properties configuration file for listeners property.

        "Impact": "If the browser is used in a shared computing environment where more than one person may use the browser, then \"autocomplete\" values may be retrieved or submitted by an unauthorized user.",
        "Solution": "Contact the vendor to have the AutoComplete attribute disabled for the password field in all forms. The AutoComplete attribute should also be disabled for the user ID field.  \nDevelopers can add the following attribute to the form or input element: autocomplete=\"off\"  \nThis attribute prevents the browser from prompting the user to save the populated form values for later reuse.   \nMost browsers no longer honor autocomplete=\"off\" for password input fields. These browsers include  Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge, IE, Opera \nHowever, there is still an ability to turn off autocomplete through the browser and that is recommended for a shared computing environment. \nSince the ability to turn autocomplete off for password inputs fields is controlled by the user it is highly recommended for application to enforce strong password rules.",

        "Threat": "A Web server was detected that supports the HTTP TRACE method. This method allows debugging and connection trace analysis for connections from the client to the Web server. Per the HTTP specification, when this method is used, the Web server echoes back the information sent to it by the client unmodified and unfiltered. Microsoft IIS web server uses an alias TRACK for this method, and is functionally the same.\n \nA vulnerability related to this method was discovered. A malicious, active component in a Web page can send Trace requests to a Web server that supports this Trace method. Usually, browser security disallows access to Web sites outside of the present site's domain. Although unlikely and difficult to achieve, it's possible, in the presence of other browser vulnerabilities, for the active HTML content to make external requests to arbitrary Web servers beyond the hosting Web server. Since the chosen Web server then echoes back the client request unfiltered, the response also includes cookie-based or Web-based (if logged on) authentication credentials that the browser automatically sent to the specified Web application on the specified Web server. \n \nThe significance of the Trace capability in this vulnerability is that the active component in the page visited by the victim user has no direct access to this authentication information, but gets it after the target Web server echoes it back as its Trace response. \n \nSince this vulnerability exists as a support for a method required by the HTTP protocol specification, most common Web servers are vulnerable.\n \nThe exact method(s) supported, Trace and/or Track, and their responses are in the Results section below.\n \nTrack / Trace are required to be disabled to be PCI compliance.",
        "Impact": "If this vulnerability is successfully exploited, users of the Web server may lose their authentication credentials for the server and/or for the Web applications hosted by the server to an attacker. This may be the case even if the Web applications are not vulnerable to cross site scripting attacks due to input validation errors.",
        "Solution": "Solutions for some of the common Web servers are supplied below. For other Web servers, please check your vendor's documentation.\n \n Apache : Recent Apache versions have a Rewrite module that allows HTTP requests to be rewritten or handled in a specific way. Compile the Apache server with the mod_rewrite module. You might need to uncomment the 'AddModule' and 'LoadModule' directives in the httpd.conf configuration file. Add the following lines for each virtualhost in your configuration file (Please note that, by default, Rewrite configurations are not inherited. This means that you need to have Rewrite directives for each virtual host in which you wish to use it):\n \n<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>\nRewriteEngine on\nRewriteCond %{REQUEST_METHOD} ^TRACE\nRewriteRule .* - [F]\n</IfModule>\n \nWith this configuration, Apache catches all TRACE requests, and replies with a page reporting the request as forbidden. None of the original request's contents are echoed back.\n \nA slightly tighter fix is to use:\n \n<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>\nRewriteEngine on\nRewriteCond %{REQUEST_METHOD} !^(GET|POST|HEAD)$\nRewriteRule .* - [F]\n</IfModule>\n \n\n Please note that RewriteEngine can be processor intensive and may impact the web server performance. The trace method can also be controlled by use of the TraceEnable directive.\n In the httpd.conf add or modify:\n \nTraceEnable Off\n \n\n \n Microsoft IIS : Microsoft released URLScan (http://support.microsoft.com/kb/307608), which can be used to screen all incoming requests based on customized rulesets. URLScan can be used to sanitize or disable the TRACE requests from the clients. Note that IIS aliases 'TRACK' to 'TRACE'. Therefore, if URLScan is used to specfically block the TRACE method, the TRACK method should also be added to the filter.\n \nURLScan uses the 'urlscan.ini' configuration file, usually in \\System32\\InetSrv\\URLScan directory. In that, we have two sections - AllowVerbs and DenyVerbs. The former is used if the UseAllowVerbs variable is set to 1, else (if its set to 0), the DenyVerbs are used. Clearly, either can be used, depending on whether we want a Default-Deny-Explicit-Allow or a Default-Allow-Explicit-Deny policy. To disallow TRACE and TRACK methods through URLScan, first remove 'TRACK', 'TRACE' methods from the 'AllowVerbs' section and add them to the 'DenyVerbs' section. With this, URLScan will disallow all 'TRACE' and 'TRACK' methods, and generate an error page for all requests using that method. To enable the changes, restart the 'World Wide Web Publishing Service' from the 'Services' Control Panel item. \nFor more details about other web servers : Cert Advisory (http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/867593).",

        "CVEResult(cve_id='CVE-2024-32962', description=\"xml-crypto is an xml digital signature and encryption library for Node.js. In affected versions the default configuration does not check authorization of the signer, it only checks the validity of the signature per section 3.2.2 of the w3 xmldsig-core-20080610 spec. As such, without additional validation steps, the default configuration allows a malicious actor to re-sign an XML document, place the certificate in a `<KeyInfo />` element, and pass `xml-crypto` default validation checks. As a result `xml-crypto` trusts by default any certificate provided via digitally signed XML document's `<KeyInfo />`. `xml-crypto` prefers to use any certificate provided via digitally signed XML document's `<KeyInfo />` even if library was configured to use specific certificate (`publicCert`) for signature verification purposes.  An attacker can spoof signature verification by modifying XML document and replacing existing signature with signature generated with malicious private key (created by attacker) and by attaching that private key's certificate to `<KeyInfo />` element. This vulnerability is combination of changes introduced to `4.0.0` on pull request 301 / commit `c2b83f98` and has been addressed in version 6.0.0 with pull request 445 / commit `21201723d`. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may either check the certificate extracted via `getCertFromKeyInfo` against trusted certificates before accepting the results of the validation or set `xml-crypto's getCertFromKeyInfo` to `() => undefined` forcing `xml-crypto` to use an explicitly configured `publicCert` or `privateKey` for signature verification.\", severity='CRITICAL', published_date='2024-05-02T07:15:21.420', modified_date='2024-11-21T09:16:07.340', score=10.0, source='NIST NVD', vuln_status='Unknown', cwe_info=['CWE-347'], affected_products=[], references=['https://github.com/node-saml/xml-crypto/commit/21201723d2ca9bc11288f62cf72552b7d659b000', 'https://github.com/node-saml/xml-crypto/commit/c2b83f984049edb68ad1d7c6ad0739ec92af11ca', 'https://github.com/node-saml/xml-crypto/pull/301', 'https://github.com/node-saml/xml-crypto/pull/445', 'https://github.com/node-saml/xml-crypto/security/advisories/GHSA-2xp3-57p7-qf4v', 'https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240705-0003/', 'https://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-xmldsig-core-20080610/#sec-CoreValidation', 'https://github.com/node-saml/xml-crypto/commit/21201723d2ca9bc11288f62cf72552b7d659b000', 'https://github.com/node-saml/xml-crypto/commit/c2b83f984049edb68ad1d7c6ad0739ec92af11ca', 'https://github.com/node-saml/xml-crypto/pull/301', 'https://github.com/node-saml/xml-crypto/pull/445', 'https://github.com/node-saml/xml-crypto/security/advisories/GHSA-2xp3-57p7-qf4v', 'https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240705-0003/', 'https://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-xmldsig-core-20080610/#sec-CoreValidation'], exploitability_score=0.0, impact_score=0.0, vector_string='CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N', cvss_version='3.1', confidence_score=10.0)",

In this case there is no way for Qualys to associate the wildcard common name to the IP. Adding a reverse DNS lookup entry to the target IP will solve this problem.",

In an SSL connection, the client authenticates the remote server using the server's Certificate and extracts the Public Key in the Certificate to establish the secure connection.\n \nThe client can trust that the Server Certificate belongs to the server only if it is signed by a mutually trusted third-party Certificate Authority (CA). Self-signed certificates are created generally for testing purposes or to avoid paying third-party CAs.

            "exploitation_methods": "The vulnerability stems from `apps.example.com` (port 443) using a self-signed SSL certificate.  This allows a network-based MITM attack.\n\nPrimary Attack Vector: An attacker with network access can intercept HTTPS traffic destined for `apps.example.com` by performing a MITM attack.  This is achieved by presenting a forged certificate that the client (e.g., a web browser) trusts, effectively intercepting all communication.  Since the server doesn't verify the client's certificate, the attacker can easily impersonate legitimate clients.\n\nPrerequisites: Network access to the target network segment where `apps.example.com` resides.  Tools like `ettercap` or `mitmproxy` are sufficient.  No credentials are required for the initial MITM.\n\nExploitation Steps: 1) The attacker positions themselves on the network path between the client and `apps.example.com`. 2) They use a MITM tool to intercept the TLS handshake. 3) They present their forged certificate, which the client accepts due to the server's lack of certificate validation. 4) All subsequent traffic is intercepted and manipulated by the attacker.\n\nPotential Impact:  The attacker can intercept sensitive data transmitted over HTTPS, including potentially user credentials, session tokens, and any other data exchanged between the client and `apps.example.com`. This could lead to account compromise and data breaches.\n\nAttack Complexity: Low.  The attack requires basic networking knowledge and readily available tools.\n\nCommon Tools: `ettercap`, `mitmproxy`, `Burp Suite`.  Automated tools can simplify the process, especially for large-scale attacks.\n\nPost-exploitation:  After gaining access to sensitive data, attackers can leverage this information for further attacks, such as credential stuffing or lateral movement within the network."
