These are considered uncommon and deprecated due to vulnerabilities when compared to newer cipher chaining modes such as CTR or GCM. 
 
2.RC4 cipher (arcfour, arcfour128, arcfour256): 
The RC4 cipher is no longer considered secure and exhibits cryptographic bias. 
 
3.Ciphers with a 64-bit block size (DES, 3DES, Blowfish, IDEA, CAST): 
These ciphers may be vulnerable to birthday attacks (Sweet32). 
 
4.Key exchange algorithms using DH group 1 (diffie-hellman-group1-sha1, gss-group1-sha1-*): 
DH group 1 uses a 1024-bit key size, which is considered too short and vulnerable to Logjam-style attacks. 

5.Key exchange algorithm ""rsa1024sha1"": 
This algorithm is very uncommon and deprecated due to its short RSA key size. 

6.MAC algorithm ""umac-32"":
